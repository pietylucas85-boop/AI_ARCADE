# 🎨 GROK USER EXPERIENCE ROAST
**Target:** Infinity Word
**Critic:** Grok (Simulated)

## The Roast
"Okay, I looked at it. It's... functional. But it feels like a spreadsheet doing cosplay as a game. Where's the dopamine? Where's the confetti?"

## 1. Boring Check
*   **Result:** VERY BORING. Simple pop animation is purely functional.
*   **Issue:** When I win, nothing happens. It just says "Splendid" in a tiny toast.
*   **Rage Quit Factor:** High if I lose by one letter and the game just resets without mocking me.

## 2. The 'Juice' Injection (Approved)
1.  **Confetti Explosion:** When the user wins, blast confetti over the screen.
2.  **Sound Effects:**
    *   `click.mp3` on keybpress.
    *   `win.mp3` on success.
3.  **Shake on Error:** Currently implemented but weak. Make it violently shake red.

## 3. Implementation Code (React)
*   *Added `canvas-confetti` library to package.json.*
*   *Updated Win Logic to trigger `confetti()`.* (See App.jsx update).

**VERDICT: ⚠️ PASSING WITH CONDITIONS. ADD CONFETTI OR I VETO.**
