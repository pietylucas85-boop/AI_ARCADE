# 🎭 StickSkit: The Anti-Boredom Protocol
**"Death to the Loading Spinner"**

## 🌟 The Vision
StickSkit is a universal "Buffering Replacement" engine. It replaces boring loading circles with context-aware, adaptive stick figure comedy skits.

## 🧠 The Vibe Engine
StickSkit adapts to the user. It's not just random; it's **personal**.

### User Profiles (The "Vibe")
1.  **The Kid (Age < 12)**
    *   *Humor:* Slapstick, simple, energetic.
    *   *Example:* Stick figure trips over a pixel. "Who put that there?!"
2.  **The Edgelord (Teen/Sarcastic)**
    *   *Humor:* Meta, dry, "over it".
    *   *Example:* "I'm loading. Don't look at me."
3.  **The Pro (Business/Office)**
    *   *Humor:* Witty, coffee-related, deadline panic.
    *   *Example:* "Synergizing the backward overflow... whatever that means."
4.  **The Gamer**
    *   *Humor:* RPG stats, loot boxes, lag jokes.
    *   *Example:* "Spawning boss monster... please wait."

## 🚀 Technical Architecture
*   **Zero-Dependency:** Pure CSS/SVG animations (lightweight).
*   **Adaptive API:** `StickSkit.init({ age: 25, vibe: 'sarcastic' })`
*   **Infinite Skits:** JSON-based script engine.
*   **Universal:** React Component, Vue Component, Vanilla JS, and Chrome Extension.

## 📦 Installation
```bash
npm install stick-skit
```

## 🔮 Future Roadmap
*   **Chrome Extension:** Replace ALL web loaders.
*   **Windows Cursor:** Replace the "Busy" cursor.
*   **AI Integration:** Real-time joke generation based on screen context.
