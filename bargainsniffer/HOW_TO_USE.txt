# BargainSniffer - Demo Guide

**What is this?**
An AI-powered search engine that hunts for deals across multiple marketplaces (Facebook, Craigslist, etc.) simultaneously. It can even identify items from photos.

**How to use:**
1.  **Open the Link:** Go to the provided URL.
2.  **Search:** Type something like "Vintage Herman Miller chair" or "PS5 console".
3.  **Photo Search (Mobile):** Click the camera icon and take a picture of an item. The AI will identify it and search for listings.
4.  **Filters:** Use the filter bar to set price ranges or distance.
5.  **Watchlist:** Click the "Heart" icon on any item to add it to your watchlist for price drop alerts (simulated).

**Note:** In this demo version, search results may be simulated if live API keys are not configured.
